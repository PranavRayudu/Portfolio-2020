Hurricanes are incredibly dangerous and powerful storms, leaving many families dislocated, and their homes destroyed. 
Hurricane Heroes is a program that uses a binary image classification to detect concentrations of damaged houses to help authorities decide what areas they should focus their efforts.
We trained a model on Azure cloud using satellite data from the National Geodetic Survey and create a visual representation to show what areas were most damaged by a hurricane.
