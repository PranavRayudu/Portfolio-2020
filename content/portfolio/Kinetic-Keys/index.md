A browser-based game where users act-out letters with their body to spell out words.
It detects letters from key body joints through a custom pose estimation model running on Tensorflow.js.
This custom vision model was refined further from the PoseNet model using a 4500+ image dataset we created for this project.  
Made in collaboration with [Mehul Daruka](https://mehul-da.github.io/) and [Mayank Daruka](https://mayankdaruka.github.io/).
