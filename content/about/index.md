title: About Me
---
Hello! I'm a sophomore at the University of Texas at Austin passionately pursuing my B.S in Computer Science. I absolutely love building an app from the bottom up using new frameworks and APIs.

This summer, I interned at Squarecap (Austin based Startup) as a software developer where I integrated live streaming features into the company's online engagement app for teachers - built on Angular and React. Moreover, I wrote web scraping scripts in Selenium and Beautiful Soup to scrape 10+ universities for potential clients, resulting in over 2000 candidates for the marketing team.

Moreover, I am deeply interested in Robotics and will spend the upcoming Fall semester on a research project on Autonomous Robots and Human-Robot interaction along with Professor Hart. Going forward, I hope to apply advanced ML techniques to make robots capable in the modern landscape.
